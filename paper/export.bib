   abstract = {Because of the contrastive differences in environment and species composition, climatic amelioration may affect alpine vegetation differently between fellfield and snowbed communities. To test this prediction, the effects of warming on plant growth and vegetation structure were studied in two fellfield and two snowbed communities in northern Japan over 7 years using open-top-chambers (OTCs). OTCs increased the temperature by 1.1-1.8 °C, but the effects on snowmelt time and soil moisture were small. Vegetation height and canopy volume increased substantially at both fellfield sites as a result of the use of OTCs. Deciduous shrubs increased substantially at the lower fellfield and graminoids increased at the upper fellfield. In contrast, the responses of snowbed plants to OTCs were not significant. Because snowbed plants are snow-covered until mid-summer, climatic amelioration during the snow-free period may influence plant growth only slightly if the snow-free period does not change. Species richness and diversity were not changed by OTCs at any of the sites, indicating that the effect of warming alone may not be strong enough to change the species composition and diversity over several years. These results indicate significant variation in the response among alpine communities to warming. © 2010 Regents of the University of Colorado.},

   abstract = {Recently, a dwarf bamboo species, Sasa kurilensis; Poaceae, has invaded into alpine snow-meadows in the wilderness area of the Taisetsu Mountains, northern Japan. This dwarf bamboo species has a wide distribution range from lowland to alpine sites of snowy regions. Because of the formation of dense evergreen culms and an extensive rhizome system, other plants are excluded following invasion by this dwarf bamboo, resulting in low species diversity. Dwarf bamboo originally inhabited the leeward slopes of alpine dwarf pine (Pinus pumila) clumps in alpine regions. During the last 32 years, however, dwarf bamboo has expanded its distribution area by up to 47% toward snow-meadows, especially on southeastern facing slopes. This rapid change may be related to the decrease in soil moisture and expansion of the annual growing period caused by the recent acceleration of snowmelt time. A multiyear census revealed that the density of bamboo culms increased 30-150% during 2 years, and the annual expansion of bamboo rhizomes was 39 cmon average. In addition to the expansion of bamboo clumps by vegetative growth, the possibility of migration by seed dispersal was also suggested by a genet analysis. With the increase in culm density, the species richness of snow-meadow vegetation decreased to less than one-quarter of the original level due to intense shading by dwarf bamboo. The rapid vegetation change in these almost pristine alpine environments isolated from the human activity implies that global climate change already influences the alpine ecosystem. © 2011 The Authors.},

   abstract = {Global climate change and sustained urban growth have increased the necessity of assessing the role that urban vegetation plays in urban dwellers' lives, as well as in urban ecosystem services. Urban environmental studies, however, still lack methods to characterize urban vegetation with adequate detail and across large areas. To remedy this gap, we apply a Support-Vector-Machine approach to classify eight frequent tree genera in the capital city of Berlin, Germany. We investigate different spectral and temporal band combinations of five RapidEye images acquired during the 2009 phenological season, and use ancillary surface and terrain models for orthorectification and improved tree masking. Results show that intra-annual time-series of RapidEye data can be used for high-precision tree genera classification in an urban environment. Differences within RapidEye time-series correlate well with empirical phenological studies of different tree genera, and RapidEye's red-edge band supports class separability. Further assessment is needed on the individual tree level and mixed stands regarding the quality of mapping urban individual trees, as our sampling approach mainly focused on larger stands with only a single tree genus. Urban applications will benefit from multitemporal RapidEye data, which offers area-wide monitoring and allows in-depth vegetation analysis to augment existing assessments. Such information is indispensable for assessing differences in urban ecosystem services related to carbon storage, cooling or air filtering, all of which differ between tree species. Therefore, the importance of in-depth analyses of urban vegetation cannot be underestimated in today's context of climate change. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

This study aimed to develop a phenology-based classification approach for the assessment of rice cropping systems in Mekong Delta, Vietnam, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The data were processed from December 2000, to December 2012, using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) in three main steps: (1) data pre-processing to construct the smooth MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI)  time-series data; (2) rice crop classification; and (3) accuracy assessment. The comparisons between the classification maps and the ground reference data indicated overall accuracies and Kappa coefficients, respectively, of 81.4% and 0.75 for 2002, 80.6% and 0.74 for 2006 and 85.5% and 0.81 for 2012. The results by comparisons between MODIS-derived rice area and rice area statistics were slightly overestimated, with a relative error in area (REA) from 0.9–15.9%. There was, however, a close correlation between the two datasets  (R2 ≥ 0.89). From 2001 to 2012, the areas of triple-cropped rice increased approximately 31.6%, while those of the single-cropped rain-fed rice, double-cropped irrigated rice and double-cropped rain-fed rice decreased roughly −5.0%, −19.2% and −7.4%, respectively. This study demonstrates the validity of such an approach for rice-crop monitoring with MODIS data and could be transferable to other regions.},

   abstract = {Local parameters for climate modelling are highly dependent on crop types and their phenological growth stage. The land cover change of agricultural areas during the growing season provides important information to distinguish crop types. The presented progressive classification algorithm identifies crop types based on their phenological development and their corresponding reflectance characteristics in multitemporal satellite images of the four sensors Landsat-7 and -8, Sentinel-2A and RapidEye. It distinguishes crop types not only retrospectively, but progressively during the growing season starting in early spring. Binary fuzzy c-means clustering differentiates seven crop types in eight decisions at particular time periods. These decisions are based on expert knowledge about plant characteristics in different phenological stages. The unsupervised classification approach and previously defined decisions enable the algorithm to work independently of training data. The fuzzy approach provides certainties of crop-type existence and generates first results in early spring. The accuracy and reliability of the classification results improve with increasing time. The method is developed at the German Durable Environmental Multidisciplinary Monitoring Information Network (DEMMIN). The study area is an official test site of the Joint Experiment of Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) and is located in an intensely agricultural used area in Northern Germany. Classification results were produced for the growing seasons 2015 and 2016. The overall accuracy in 2015 amounted to 89.49%. A challenge remains the distinct separation of wheat and rye, whereas barley, rapeseed, potato, corn and sugar beet are classified with high accuracies. The overall accuracy in 2016 was lower (77.19%) due to unfavourable weather conditions.},

The post-processing requires a significant amount of steps to transform images into meaningful data for quantitative analysis, such as velocity fields. To the best of our knowledge at present a complete, openly available package that encompasses georeferencing, georectification and feature tracking of terrestrial, oblique images is still absent. This study presents a complete, yet adaptable, opensource package developed in MATLAB, that addresses and combines each of these post-processing steps into one complete suite in the form of an "Image GeoRectification and Feature Tracking" (ImGRAFT: http://imgraft.glaciology.net) toolbox. The toolbox can also independently produce other useful outputs, such as viewsheds, georectified and orthorectified images. ImGRAFT is primarily focused on terrestrial oblique images, for which there are currently limited post-processing options available.

Using these parameters, the 3-D position of a point in the scene, which is identified and matched in two stereo images, can be determined by the method of triangulation. In this paper, we present a camera model that accounts for major sources of camera distortion, namely, radial, decentering, and thin prism distortions. The proposed calibration procedure consists of two steps. In the first step, the calibration parameters are estimated using a closed-form solution based on a distortion-free camera model. In the second step, the parameters estimated in the first step are improved iteratively through a nonlinear optimization, taking into account camera distortions. According to minimum variance estimation, the objective function to be minimized is the mean-square discrepancy between the observed image points and their inferred image projections computed with the estimated calibration parameters. We introduce a type of measure that can be used to directly evaluate the performance of calibration and compare calibrations among different systems. The validity and performance of our calibration procedure are tested with both synthetic data and real images taken by tele-and wide-angle lenses. The results consistently show significant improvements over less complete camera models.},

   abstract = {Recent years have seen a surge of interest in understanding patterns and processes of plant invasions into mountains. Here, we synthesise current knowledge about the spread of non-native plants along elevation gradients, emphasising the current status and impacts that these species have in alpine ecosystems. Globally, invasions along elevation gradients are influenced by propagule availability, environmental constraints on population growth, evolutionary change and biotic interactions. The highest elevations are so far relatively free from non-native plants. Nonetheless, in total nearly 200 non-native plant species have been recorded from alpine environments around the world. However, we identified only three species as specifically cold-adapted, with the overwhelming majority having their centres of distribution under warmer environments, and few have substantial impacts on native communities. A combination of low propagule availability and low invasibility likely explain why alpine environments host few non-native plants relative to lowland ecosystems. However, experiences in some areas demonstrate that alpine ecosystems are not inherently resistant to invasions. Furthermore, they will face increasing pressure from the introduction of pre-adapted species, climate change, and the range expansion of native species, which are already causing concern in some areas. Nonetheless, because they are still relatively free from non-native plants, preventative action could be an effective way to limit future impacts of invasions in alpine environments.},

The distribution of P. pumila is strongly related to the distribution of snow, and shoot growth is also sensitive to weather conditions. Changes in temperature and snowmelt regimes may well affect the distribution patterns of the krummholz zone. P. pumila usually occupies the habitat between the fellfield and snowbed communities, and responses to climate change may differ depending on whether plants are close to the fellfield or the snowbed. We compared the distribution and shoot growth patterns of P. pumila close to both surrounding ecosystems in the Taisetsu Mountains, northern Japan. P. pumila has expanded its distribution area by 14 % toward both edges over the last 32 years. Annual shoot growth was positively affected by summer temperature and sunshine duration, but negatively related to spring temperature toward the fellfield side. Shoot growth was greater at the southeastern edge of patches, where snowdrifts were formed. The results indicated that shoot growth and distribution area increased in warm summers. However, warm springs might have a negative influence on shoot growth, probably because the earlier reduction in cold-resistance enhances the risk of frost damage in spring close to the fellfield side. This study suggests the importance of understanding the site-specific responses of shrubs to predict the impacts of climate change on alpine ecosystems.},

We evaluated the correspondence between field measures of start (SOS; leaves unfolded and canopy greenness &gt;0) and end of season (EOS) and canopy greenness for two widespread species in southwestern U.S. ecosystems with those metrics estimated from near-surface cameras and MODIS NDVI for five years (2012–2016). Using Timesat software to estimate SOS and EOS from the phenocam green chromatic coordinate (GCC) greenness index resulted in good agreement with ground observations for honey mesquite but not black grama. Despite differences in the detectability of SOS and EOS for the two species, GCC was significantly correlated with field estimates of canopy greenness for both species throughout the growing season. MODIS NDVI for this arid grassland site was driven by the black grama signal although a mesquite signal was discernable in average rainfall years.

   abstract = {We propose a novel and fast multiscale feature detection and description approach that exploits the benefits of nonlinear scale spaces. Previous attempts to detect and describe features in nonlinear scale spaces such as KAZE [1] and BFSIFT [6] are highly time consuming due to the computational burden of creating the nonlinear scale space. In this paper we propose to use recent numerical schemes called Fast Explicit Diffusion (FED) [3, 4] embedded in a pyramidal framework to dramatically speed-up feature detection in nonlinear scale spaces. In addition, we introduce a Modified-Local Difference Binary (M-LDB) descriptor that is highly efficient, exploits gradient information from the nonlinear scale space, is scale and rotation invariant and has low storage requirements. Our features are called Accelerated-KAZE (A-KAZE) due to the dramatic speed-up introduced by FED schemes embedded in a pyramidal framework. 1 Accelerated KAZE Features Building the nonlinear scale space. We use FED schemes for building a nonlinear scale space from which we can detect and describe features. By means of FED schemes, a nonlinear scale space can be built much faster than with any other kind of discretization scheme. Furthermore, FED schemes are extremely easy to implement and are more accurate than revious approaches such as Additive Operator Splitting (AOS) [7]. The main idea is to perform M cycles of n explicit diffusion steps with varying step sizes τ j that originate from the factorization of a box filter: τ j = τ max 2 cos 2 π 2 j+1 4n+2 (1) Feature Detection. We compute the determinant of the Hessian for each of the filtered images L i in the nonlinear scale space. The set of differential multiscale operators are normalized with respect to scale, using a normalized scale factor that takes into account the octave of each particular image in the nonlinear scale space. Then, we search for maxima of the detector response in scale and spatial location. L i Hessian = σ 2 i,norm L i xx L i yy − L i xy L i xy. (2) Feature Description. We propose a Modified-Local Difference Binary (M-LDB) that exploits gradient and intensity information from the nonlinear scale space. The LDB descriptor was introduced in [8] and follows the same principle as BRIEF [2], but using binary tests between the average of areas instead of single pixels for additional robustness. In addition to the intensity values, the mean of the horizontal and vertical derivatives in the areas being compared is used, resulting in 3 bits per comparison. Rotation invariance is obtained by estimating the main orientation of the keypoint as in KAZE, and the grid of LDB rotated accordingly. Instead of using the average of all pixels inside each subdivision of the grid, we subsample the grids in steps that are a function of the scale σ of the feature. The scale-dependent sampling in turn makes the descriptor robust to changes in scale. 2 Evaluation We present an extensive evaluation based on the standard Oxford benchmark [5] that shows the excellent compromise between speed and performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods such as BRISK, ORB, SURF, SIFT and KAZE. While A-KAZE is more expensive to compute than BRISK and ORB, it is faster than SURF, SIFT and KAZE. More specifically, A-KAZE is several orders of magnitude faster (a) LDB binary test (b) M-LDB binary test Figure 1: LDB [8] and proposed M-LDB binary tests between grid divisions around a keypoint, shown for the intensity and the gradients in x.

In addition, due to the use of binary descriptors the matching step can be computed very efficiently using the Hamming distance. (a) (b) Figure 2: Descriptor and timing evaluation.

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

computer vision. In this paper, we investigate the problem of scene text
recognition, which is among the most important and challenging tasks in

integrates feature extraction, sequence modeling and transcription into a
unified framework, is proposed. Compared with previous systems for scene text
recognition, the proposed architecture possesses four distinctive properties:
(1) It is end-to-end trainable, in contrast to most of the existing algorithms
whose components are separately trained and tuned. (2) It naturally handles
sequences in arbitrary lengths, involving no character segmentation or
horizontal scale normalization. (3) It is not confined to any predefined
lexicon and achieves remarkable performances in both lexicon-free and
lexicon-based scene text recognition tasks. (4) It generates an effective yet
much smaller model, which is more practical for real-world application
scenarios. The experiments on standard benchmarks, including the IIIT-5K,
Street View Text and ICDAR datasets, demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed algorithm over the prior arts. Moreover, the proposed algorithm
performs well in the task of image-based music score recognition, which

We propose a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) with learnable gated linear units (GLUs) non-linearity applied on the log Mel spectrogram. In addition, we propose a temporal attention method along the frames to predict the locations of each audio event in a chunk from the weakly labelled data.

@article{Hansen2003CMAES,
   abstract = {This paper presents a novel evolutionary optimization strategy based on the deran-domized evolution strategy with covariance matrix adaptation (CMA-ES). This new approach is intended to reduce the number of generations required for convergence to the optimum. Reducing the number of generations, i.e., the time complexity of the algorithm, is important if a large population size is desired: (1) to reduce the effect of noise; (2) to improve global search properties; and (3) to implement the algorithm on (highly) parallel machines. Our method results in a highly parallel algorithm which scales favorably with large numbers of processors. This is accomplished by efficiently incorporating the available information from a large population, thus significantly reducing the number of generations needed to adapt the covariance matrix. The original version of the CMA-ES was designed to reliably adapt the covariance matrix in small populations but it cannot exploit large populations efficiently. Our modifications scale up the efficiency to population sizes of up to 10n, where n is the problem dimension. This method has been applied to a large number of test problems, demonstrating that in many cases the CMA-ES can be advanced from quadratic to linear time complexity.},

How to efficiently analyze such a kind of information is still an open question in the remote sensing field. Recently, deep learning methods proved suitable to deal with remote sensing data mainly for scene classification(i.e., convolutional neural networks on single images) while only very few studies exist involving temporal deep learning approaches [i.e., recurrent neural networks (RNNs)] to deal with remote sensing time series. In this letter, we evaluate the ability of RNNs, in particular, the long short-term memory (LSTM) model, to perform land cover classification considering multitemporal spatial data derived from a time series of satellite images. We carried out experiments on two different data sets considering both pixel-based and object-based classifications. The obtained results show that RNNs are competitive compared with the state-of-the-art classifiers, and may outperform classical approaches in the presence of low represented and/or highly mixed classes. We also show that the alternative feature representation generated by LSTM can improve the performances of standard classifiers.},

   abstract = {Environmental sustainability research is dependent on accurate land cover information. Even with the increased number of satellite systems and sensors acquiring data with improved spectral, spatial, radiometric and temporal characteristics and the new data distribution policy, most existing land cover datasets are derived from a pixel-based, single-date multi-spectral remotely sensed image with an unacceptable accuracy. One major bottleneck for accuracy improvement is how to develop an accurate and effective image classification protocol. By incorporating and utilizing multi-spectral, multi-temporal and spatial information in remote sensing images and considering the inherit spatial and sequential interdependence among neighboring pixels, we propose a new patch-based recurrent neural network (PB-RNN) system tailored for classifying multi-temporal remote sensing data. The system is designed by incorporating distinctive characteristics of multi-temporal remote sensing data. In particular, it uses multi-temporal–spectral–spatial samples and deals with pixels contaminated by clouds/shadow present in multi-temporal data series. Using a Florida Everglades ecosystem study site covering an area of 771 square kilometers, the proposed PB-RNN system has achieved a significant improvement in the classification accuracy over a pixel-based recurrent neural network (RNN) system, a pixel-based single-image neural network (NN) system, a pixel-based multi-image NN system, a patch-based single-image NN system, and a patch-based multi-image NN system. For example, the proposed system achieves 97.21% classification accuracy while the pixel-based single-image NN system achieves 64.74%. By utilizing methods like the proposed PB-RNN one, we believe that much more accurate land cover datasets can be produced over large areas.},

Ground surface change challenges feature point detection in amount and quality, which is a common dilemma faced by feature-based registration algorithms. Under severe appearance variation, detected feature points may contain a large proportion of outliers, whereas inliers may be inadequate and unevenly distributed. This paper presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) feature-based multi-temporal remote sensing image registration method with two key contributions: (i) we use a CNN to generate robust multi-scale feature descriptors and (ii) we design a gradually increasing selection of inliers to improve the robustness of feature point registration. Extensive experiments on feature matching and image registration are performed over a multi-temporal satellite image data set and a multi-temporal unmanned aerial vehicle image dataset.

   abstract = {Establishing accurate anatomical correspondences is critical for medical image registration. Although many hand-engineered features have been proposed for correspondence detection in various registration applications, no features are general enough to work well for all image data. Although many learning-based methods have been developed to help selection of best features for guiding correspondence detection across subjects with large anatomical variations, they are often limited by requiring the known correspondences (often presumably estimated by certain registration methods) as the ground truth for training. To address this limitation, we propose using an unsupervised deep learning approach to directly learn the basis filters that can effectively represent all observed image patches. Then, the coefficients by these learnt basis filters in representing the particular image patch can be regarded as the morphological signature for correspondence detection during image registration. Specifically, a stacked two-layer convolutional network is constructed to seek for the hierarchical representations for each image patch, where the high-level features are inferred from the responses of the low-level network. By replacing the hand-engineered features with our learnt data-adaptive features for image registration, we achieve promising registration results, which demonstrates that a general approach can be built to improve image registration by using data-adaptive features through unsupervised deep learning. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {Alpine ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Although long-term and detailed monitoring is required to conserve alpine ecosystems, field surveillance and satellite remote sensing have difficulties in providing wide coverage or frequent observation in mountain areas. In this study, a new method for monitoring alpine ecosystems by digital cameras was developed in order to detect both snow-cover areas and vegetation phenology at the plant community or species level. We used images from cameras that have been installed at mountain lodges in the northern Japanese Alps (at elevations around 2350-3100. m). Red, green, and blue (RGB) digital numbers were derived from each pixel within the images. The snow-cover and snow-free pixels were statistically classified by analysis of variance of gray-level histograms. A flexible threshold was determined for each image to maximize the between-class variance. The temporal variations of the snowmelt rate showed site-specific characteristics and yearly variations. The snowmelt times reflected the local microtopography and differed among the habitats of various functional types of vegetation (i.e., evergreen dwarf pine, deciduous shrubs, evergreen Sasa, tall forbs, and snowbed plants). In addition, the vegetation phenology was quantified by using a vegetation index (green ratio) calculated from RGB digital numbers. An increase in the green ratio indicated the start of the growing period following snowmelt and a decrease indicated leaf senescence. By using pixel-based analysis of the temporal variations of the green ratio, local distributions of the start and end dates and length of the growing period were illustrated at the plant species level for the first time. The distribution of the start of the growing period strongly corresponded to the snowmelt gradient, whereas the end of the growing period was related to the vegetation type. Our results suggest that the length of the growing period mainly corresponded to the snowmelt gradient in relation to the local microtopography. Thus, commercially available digital time-lapse cameras enabled us to clarify the snow-vegetation relationships and the growing period at high temporal and spatial resolutions. This monitoring method should greatly improve our understanding of alpine ecosystems and help to assess the influence of future climate change. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Snow cover variability has a significant impact on climate and the environment and is of great socioeconomic importance for the European Alps. Terrestrial photography offers a high potential to monitor snow cover variability, but its application is often limited to small catchment scales. Here, we present a semiautomatic procedure to derive snow cover maps from publicly available webcam images in the Swiss Alps and propose a procedure for the georectification and snow classification of such images. In order to avoid the effort of manually setting ground control points (GCPs) for each webcam, we implement a novel registration approach that automatically resolves camera parameters (camera orientation; principal point; field of view, FOV) by using an estimate of the webcams' positions and a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM). Furthermore, we propose an automatic image-to-image alignment to correct small changes in camera orientation and compare and analyze two recent snow classification methods. The resulting snow cover maps indicate whether a DEM grid is snow-covered, snow-free, or not visible from webcams' positions. GCPs are used to evaluate our novel automatic image registration approach. The evaluation reveals a root mean square error (RMSE) of 14.1&thinsp;m for standard lens webcams (<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">FOV&lt;48</span><span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">ĝ&circ;</span>) and a RMSE of 36.3&thinsp;m for wide-angle lens webcams (<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">FOV≥48</span><span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">ĝ&circ;</span>). In addition, we discuss projection uncertainties caused by the mapping of low-resolution webcam images onto the high-resolution DEM.

   abstract = {There is a need to document how plant phenology is responding to global change factors, particularly warming trends. "Near-surface" remote sensing, using radiometric instruments or imaging sensors, has great potential to improve phenological monitoring because automated observations can be made at high temporal frequency. Here we build on previous work and show how inexpensive, networked digital cameras ("webcams") can be used to document spatial and temporal variation in the spring and autumn phenology of forest canopies. We use two years of imagery from a deciduous, northern hardwood site, and one year of imagery from a coniferous, boreal transition site. A quantitative signal is obtained by splitting images into separate red, green, and blue color channels and calculating the relative brightness of each channel for "regions of interest" within each image. We put the observed phenological signal in context by relating it to seasonal patterns of gross primary productivity, inferred from eddy covariance measurements of surface-atmosphere CO2 exchange. We show that spring increases, and autumn decreases, in canopy greenness can be detected in both deciduous and coniferous stands. In deciduous stands, an autumn red peak is also observed. The timing and rate of spring development and autumn senescence varies across the canopy, with greater variability in autumn than spring. Interannual variation in phenology can be detected both visually and quantitatively; delayed spring onset in 2007 compared to 2006 is related to a prolonged cold spell from day 85 to day 110.

distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters

learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously
hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this
phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing
layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of
the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training
mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and
be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some
cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image
classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14
times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant
margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the
best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5
